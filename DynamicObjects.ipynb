    "# Dynamically Creating Usable Python Objects - The Overlay Class\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the features of Python that we exploit in PYNQ is the loose typing system that allows to generate and modify types at runtime. BY doing this we can offer more Pythonic APIs generated in large part from user-supplied data than would be possible in a more rigid type system. In the world of PYNQ we have _overlays_ which contain one or more pieces of _IP_ - distinct pieces of the programmable logic which are interacted with through drivers. One of the main ways PYNQ provides for interacting with overlays is the `Overlay` class which gives access to IP using dynamically generated attributes. For example.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "ol = pynq.Overlay('my_biststream.bit')\n",
    "ol.gpio_btns.channel1.read()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "While on the surface this code appears to be simple, underneath there is a lot of functionality contained in those two lines. For these lines to be functional the PYNQ runtime needs to:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Parse some metadata to figure out what's in `my_bitstream.bit`\n",
    " 2. Know that the `gpio_btns` IP should have a GPIO driver attached to it\n",
    " 3. Add an attribute to `ol` called `gpio_btns` with the appropriate driver\n",
    "\n",
    "Step one of this process has already been covered by my colleague in a [previous blog](https://discuss.pynq.io/t/whats-in-my-bitstream-a-pythonic-approach-to-discovering-fpga-contents/653). so here I'm going to see what goes into steps two and three. Through the course of the blog I'm going to build up a simplified version of the Overlay class to give some intuition as to what's going on under the hood and to offer ideas for other uses of these techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to explore the code directly there is a [Binder version of this post](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/PeterOgden/PythonObjects/master) where you can run all of the example code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our starting dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about how the dictionaries are parsed from the meta-data I would recommend going through [Rock's blog on the topic](https://discuss.pynq.io/t/whats-in-my-bitstream-a-pythonic-approach-to-discovering-fpga-contents/653). For this example we're going to use a very stripped down version of the IP dictionary that only contains the name of the IP and the type of the IP."

In PYNQ this is the `DefaultIP` class and for consistency I'll use the same name for this example. The implementation doesn't impact how the binding process happens so I'm going to leave it blank to avoid complicating the code snippets."
